25 September and 21 October will be the first editions of Amsterdam‚Äôs new techno club concept Ratherlost in Lofi. Aiming to create a dancefloor dimension where losing track of space and time together stimulates a collective state of freedom, inspiration, (self-)exploration and realignment with yourself and your surroundings. 

The concept's kick-off coincides with Lofi's seasonal Courtyard closing. Bringing together a steaming selection of artists under the pergola of our beloved urban playground once more to close the summer together in style.

For the 2nd edition of Ratherlost, we will dive deep into Lofi's warehouse-club on the Friday night of ADE. With a stacked line-up of quality techno tastemakers taking us on a 10-hour trip over a powerful yet crystal clear soundsystem.
