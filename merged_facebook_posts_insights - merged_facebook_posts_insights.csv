RATHERLOST x Lofi ADE

25 September and 21 October will be the first editions of Amsterdam’s new techno club concept Ratherlost in Lofi. Aiming to create a dancefloor dimension where losing track of space and time together stimulates a collective state of freedom, inspiration, (self-)exploration and realignment with yourself and your surroundings. 

The concept's kick-off coincides with Lofi's seasonal Courtyard closing. Bringing together a steaming selection of artists under the pergola of our beloved urban playground once more to close the summer together in style.

For the 2nd edition of Ratherlost, we will dive deep into Lofi's warehouse-club on the Friday night of ADE. With a stacked line-up of quality techno tastemakers taking us on a 10-hour trip over a powerful yet crystal clear soundsystem.

“Launching our event series felt like the natural next step for our label. Events bring our music to life, and we’re excited to share the passion and energy that made us fall in love with it—alongside our favorite artists and with all of you.

As the founder of Nali, I’ve been privileged to witness artists grow, refine their sound, and fully embrace their unique musical identity—turning their guilty pleasures into signature sounds. This has been the most rewarding part of this journey, and I truly hope our event series will continue to inspire the same freedom and authenticity.”

For the first time we shared a full earth rotation on Lofi’s dancefloors. An adventure of ultimately 27 hours travelling through different phases, stages, sounds and energies. From the depths of night through the gentle embrace of sunlight and back into the velvet darkness.

A big salute to all you dancers for contributing your energy, and trusting in the journey. To all artists for bringing your A-game to the time of day, daring to be different. And to the incredible audiovisual and Lofi crews for powering through this marathon ❤‍🔥

Together, we’ve created a dimension of freedom, where boundaries dissolved and made way for pure presence, expression and connection. And this is what truly drives us.

This gathering has undoubtedly etched itself as one of our favorites, largely due its dynamic. From the warehouse intensity, to the sunrise euphoria. Foggy colorfloor realms to Sunday’s tribal beats, every moment was a brushstroke in our collective piece.
